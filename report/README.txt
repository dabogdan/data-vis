Dear teacher

I created map and round chat. I picked the idea from the Slack chats, where students shot videos of their projects. 

I would do sketches but I actually managed to visualise them both in the app itself and have spent a lot of the time on that, rather than drawing things on paper. Apologies for this, but I am not good at drawing anyway. Also, when I tested the app, it does not function in browser (even the template coming from Coursera), but it does work when you use WebStorm online server, so please use it with some sort of debugging server, it should work properly.

However, I add the pdf document called "Project planning" where I list all my thoughts, brainstorming since when I watched the video lectures for the project planning. I added on through my coursework implementation when had new ideas or faced significant challenges. Not everything is recorded, but I hope you will be able to trace in folder q2.

All my research, challenges and plans I fully describe in the Coursera platform answering to all of the Questions.

I also add Gantt chart with my time planning.

Thank you very much for your time and assessment.

Sincerely
